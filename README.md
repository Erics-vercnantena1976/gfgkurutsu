OMG, just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 Black Bag and dude, my brain’s like scattered all over the place! Seriously, what did I just see? Like, I was glued to the screen but also kinda annoyed, in the best way possible, you know what I mean? It’s like, when you're so into something and yet you can hear yourself ranting internally about it. 😂 Sometimes impressive but also a bit overwhelming, like trying to juggle cats, or my thoughts about it, lol!

The colors, my eyes are still reeling a bit. They really know how to throw some heavy hues at you, huh? Shiny but gritty. Was it just me, or did every character look like they hadn't slept for a week? Ugh, so tired-looking. Relatable, though, ‘cause same. 

And the dialogue! So many layers, man. You have to really pay attention but also feels like it's messing with your head intentionally. I mean, at one point, I was like, wait, did I accidentally 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   from some indie dream world festival or what? Anyway, I definitely need to digest it a bit. Maybe a second 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   attempt when my brain’s not mush? Hope I won’t jab my eyes out from exhaustion next time. 😆

> That scene with the briefcase! No spoilers, but what was THAT about?! Felt like they were just playing with my nerves, just twisting ‘em slowly like they had nothing better to do. Such a trip. Might’ve laughed at the intensity, or maybe I was just tired, who knows. 

Anyway, post-𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 mind is a mix of shock and huh, and already looking forward to picking apart whatever symbolism I missed the first time. They always pack those in, like a chaotic grocery bag full of undelivered metaphors, ya know?

int  Analysis = 0;  // why is this even here? 😂

Anyway, hands down, was a wild ride. Let’s chat more in depth when both our minds are less scrambled. Hope your night’s been less brain-fried than mine! Later! 🚀
